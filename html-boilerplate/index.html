        Welcome to WickerNet
        The most WICKED of all Fansites
        <p>Hello, and welcome to WickerNet. This is a website I build while I was learning how to develop software 
        through The Odin Project. I built it as a way to apply the concepts I was learning. You might be asking yourself, 
        why I am telling you this. Well the answer is because I needed content for the website I was building.</p>
        Dedicated to my favorite YouTuber TheRussianBadger
        <p>Being that this is a fansite, it has to have a topic. There were several ideas that I was mulling over before
        making a decision. Originally, I wanted to make it about this fantasy creature I found out about called a WickerBeast.
        Hence where the name of the site name came from. Then it changed, and I was gonna make it about my favoite dreadnought, the 
        Moros Navy Issue, a ship from the game Eve Online. However I decided to not pursue this mainly because I was unsure of how far 
        I could take the topic of the Moros Navy Issue.</p> 
        <p>Enter Badger, TheRussianBadger is a Canadian YouTuber and Twitch streamer known for the comedic and self-deprecating 
        style he lends to his videos.</p>
